[Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com) is one of the leading global online food ordering 
and delivery marketplaces. It processes more than 3 million orders per day, partnering with 
over 500 thousand restaurants and a fleet of riders.

with over 22 thousand employees globally.

Here, I am working on the backend for campaign-related features in [Foodpanda](https://www.foodpanda.com) 
and [Foodora](https://www.foodora.com) by using Go, Redis, DynamoDB, Kubernetes, 
with Amazon Web Service as the main infrastructure. The backend of our main project, 
[Campaign Carousel](/foodpanda-campaign-carousel), 
can handle more than 700 thousand requests per minute.

In Call Levels, I was working on the new backend for the price monitoring and notification system 
by using Go and Google Cloud Platform technologies (such as Google Kubernetes Engine). 
My team's main goal was to create a new backend with better performance compared with the 
previous backend app.

I was also working on the backend for Call Levels chat solution with Node.js and Google Dialogflow.


### GDP Labs (2015 - 2018)

GDP (Global Digital Prima) Labs, founded in 2012, is a software product development-centric 
organization based in Indonesia.
It's main goal is to help sister companies and incubate startups.

In GDP Labs, I was mainly working on two big projects from [Kaskus](https://kaskus.co.id),
the biggest online forum in Indonesia. The projects are 
Kaskus Big Data and [Kaspay](https://kaspay.com). 
 
#### Kaskus Big Data

My team built the data pipeline in Kaskus by using Google Cloud Platform 
(e.g. Dataflow, PubSub, BigQuery) and Apache Airflow.
We stored the whole data inside BigQuery. Then it can be used by the data analysts to create reports 
and also the data scientists to build machine learning models.

#### Kaspay

Kaspay consists of payment bot (available on FB Messenger, Telegram, Line, and Kaskus Chat), 
wallet, voucher, and invoice system which were developed with Java (with Spring Framework) 
for the backend, and React for the frontend.
