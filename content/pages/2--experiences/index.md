In Call Levels, I was working on the new backend for the price monitoring and notification system 
using Go and Google Cloud Platform technologies (such as Google Kubernetes Engine). 
My team's main goal was to create a new backend with better performance compared with the 
previous backend app.

### GDP Labs (2015 - 2018)

GDP (Global Digital Prima) Labs, founded in 2012, is a software product development-centric 
organization based in Indonesia.
It's main goal is to help sister companies and incubate startups.

In GDP Labs, I was mainly working on two big projects from [Kaskus](https://kaskus.co.id),
the biggest online forum in Indonesia. The projects are 
Kaskus Big Data and [Kaspay](https://kaspay.com). 
 
#### Kaskus Big Data

My team built the data pipeline in Kaskus using Google Cloud Platform 
(e.g. Dataflow, PubSub, BigQuery) and Apache Airflow.
We stored the whole data inside BigQuery. Then it can be used for data analyst to create reports and 
data scientist to build machine learning models.

#### Kaspay

wallet, voucher, and invoice system which are developed with Spring Framework with Java 8 for the backend, 
and React for the frontend.
