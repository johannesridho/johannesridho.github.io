In March 2020, I gave a talk with title 
"High Performance Location-based Restaurant Campaigns in Foodpanda" in 
[FOSSASIA Summit](https://summit.fossasia.org). 
This talk highlighted how my team solved a problem where our 
service needs to return the list of campaigns based on 
the user location and the delivery 
areas of the restaurants participating in the campaigns. 
This service is now able to handle more than 700 thousand requests per minute.
