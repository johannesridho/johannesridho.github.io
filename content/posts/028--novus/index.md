Novus is a new social network where people can see 
other people's Augmented Reality contents that are attached to 
the objects around their location. We are hoping that Novus can drive 
people to go outside and do offline interaction more 
with other people around their location. This also leads people to form 
a community based on content and interest around their location.
My team built Novus at F8 Hackathon 2018.

Technologies: Augmented Reality, Android, Unity3D, Vuforia, Facebook Login
