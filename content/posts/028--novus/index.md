Novus is a new social network where people can see 
other people's Augmented Reality contents attached to 
the objects around their location. 
Novus was built to drive people to go outside and do more offline interaction 
with other people around their location. It can lead people to form 
a new community, based on contents and interests around their location.
My team built Novus in F8 Hackathon 2018.

My teammate wrote about the idea here: https://medium.com/@tsambora/startup-idea-s-ar-internet-c2dc8a851531.
